# colabtutorials
- I am starting this repo with multiple things in mind. Let us see how this turns out.
- To teach my kids & myself on how Google Colab works
- To teach my kids & myself on pythhon notebooks & how to learn through experimenting with code interactively
- Learn some markdown features & how to integrate them within the python notebooks to make a nice notebook that can be extended, reused & experimented with.
