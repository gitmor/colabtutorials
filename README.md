# colabtutorials
- I am starting this repo with multiple things in mind. Let us see how this turns out.
- To teach my kids & myself on how Google Colab works
- To teach my kids & myself on python notebooks & how to learn through experimenting with code interactively
- Learn some markdown features & how to integrate them within the python notebooks to make a nice notebook that can be extended, reused & experimented with.
- Teach my kids on how to work collaboratively through git & perhaps teach them some features on distributed work, git commits branching etc.
- Perhaps I am trying to achieve too many items with just one repo, but I want to try how to experiment with developing a curriculum that integrates many features in to a practical application subset that might prove useful & extensible.
